    "### Basic Idea\n",
    "To recover the hidden time information, Dennis Gabor introduced in the year 1946 the short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Instead of considering the entire signal, the main idea of the STFT is to consider only a small section of the signal. To this end, one fixes a so-called window function, which is a function that is nonzero for only a short period of time (defining the considered section). The original signal is then multiplied with the window function to yield a windowed signal. To obtain frequency information at different time instances, one shifts the window function across time and computes a Fourier transform for each of the resulting windowed signals. This idea is illustrated by the next example."

First of all, the STFT depends on the length of the window, which determines the size of the section. Then, the STFT is influenced by the shape of the window. For example, the sharp edges of the rectangular window typically introduce \"ripple\" artifacts. We discuss such issues in more detail later."
